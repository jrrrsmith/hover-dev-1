It's amazing to see artists working in schools, especially public schools - in a flowing creative space. It takes hard work over time to build something like that. 

**[Found Sound Nation](http://foundsoundnation.org/)**, a non-profit organization based in DUMBO, has been working at the **[Brooklyn Community Arts and Media High School](http://www.bcamhs.org/)** for years, partnering with BCAM’s music program and bringing artists to collaborate with students.

 This video documents one of the collaborations. The People’s Champs, a Brooklyn-based band,  teamed up for a two-week workshop with a select group of BCAM students with whom they wrote and produced original Hip-Hop songs.

Our video begins by telling their story through glimpses in nascent songwriting stages at the workshop, in the basement studio of the school, interspersed with interviews from the students themselves relating their day-to-day lives and experiences. In these interviews we get a hint at their inner worlds and inspirations.

The students then get the opportunity to record their songs at a professional recording studio in the heart of Williamsburg: National Sawdust. After recording their songs, they perform them live during a concert with People’s Champs. Debuting their freshly recorded creations for a raucous crowd of family members and people in the music industry, we bear witness to a beautiful night of musical collaboration - a release of two weeks of intense creativity.
