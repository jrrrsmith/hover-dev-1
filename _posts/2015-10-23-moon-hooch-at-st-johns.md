Director [Lucas McGowen](http://lucasmcgowen.com) heads to Harlem tonight to participate in filming a live event put on by a trio of talented jazz artists known as **Moon Hooch**. They're known for their natural dance tunes, or “organic house music.”

The event will be held at the **Cathedral of St. John the Divine**, the largest cathedral in the world and home to the month-long **Value of Food – Sustaining a Green Planet Exhibit**.

Lucas’s cousin, **Wenzl McGowen** plays saxophone for Moon Hooch. Last year, Lucas directed this energetic [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUEapzqptIA) that played at **SXSW**.

Tonight, Lucas collaborates with set-light artist **John Zelenka** of **Manhattan Microwave Communications** – on laser light design, CO2, and smoke. The event will be captured on a C100 and two 5D cameras. 

Sustainability is central to the rising band’s mission. Stay tuned for the footage of the night.
