After a certain point, even living in a place like New York City can start to feel mundane. You fall into routines and as things become familiar, so too can they become a forgettable part of the daily grind. Which is why it's so important that photographers like [Camila Falquez](http://www.camilafalquez.com) are out there, reminding to look at the world around us with a little more consideration, with a little more love. Her compositions are powerful, thought provoking, and are as smart as they are immediately satisfying. She has a way of capturing the striking beauty in the every day. They feel classic, nostalgic for the present. 

We were lucky enough to catch her in New York and get our [portraits](http://hoverpictures.com/about/) taken here at the Hover HQ. Ever at the helm of inspiration, Camila's camera inevitably wandered out of our 2nd story studio and into the vibrant streets of Chinatown, reminding us of all the ways in which this neighborhood is really so, so special.

*Hover Pictures:* Tell us a bit about yourself - dreams, hopes, goals. 

*Camila Falquez:* I was born in Mexico, raised in Spain and now I live in New York. My priority in life is traveling and understanding society, every day harder to define as I learn more about it. 

My hopes? Continuing to have the freedom I have to travel around with my camera.

*H:* Were you thinking about anything in particular when you were taking these photographs? How do they resonate with you now?

*C:* When I shoot the streets, I try to leave my mind blank and let the visuals of what I'm exploring guide me. It's almost like a meditation process, always very rewarding.

*H:* When was the first time you visited Chinatown? Do you feel it's changed much since, visually? If so, in what ways? 

*C:* Chinatown was one of the first areas I visited when I first moved to New York 4 years ago, and it blew me away. It still has the same effect on me; its energy and amazing contrasts captivate me enormously.

![Camila's Chinatown #7](/assets/posts/camila-chinatown-7.jpg){: .multi-post-two-up }

*H:* There's a definite history of infatuation with the aesthetic and aura of Chinatown. What about it draws you in? What do you see in it? 

*C:* The colors, the smells, people of all ages... all together produce a very vibrant melting pot.

![Camila's Chinatown #9](/assets/posts/camila-chinatown-9.jpg){: .multi-post-two-up }

*H:* I feel like there's a real sense of the weather in these photographs that seems distinctly Chinatown. What was the weather actually like that day?

*C:* It was a cloudy autumn day, which couln't be any more perfect for the vibe of the pictures.

![Camila's Chinatown #10](/assets/posts/camila-chinatown-10.jpg){: .multi-post-single } 

*H:* What are your favorite things to do in Chinatown? 

*C:* Firstly, just walking around rush hour and absorbing all of that energy; but also, at night, when all of those streets are asleep, it's amazing to walk around in search of some good restaurant.
