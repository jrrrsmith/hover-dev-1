This week, three of our films will premiere at the The **[SEMA](http://www.semashow.com)** Show in Las Vegas.

**SEMA** is the world’s leading automotive specialty products trade event. It draws the industry’s brightest minds and latest products. Attendees go to educational seminars, product demonstrations, and special events.

This is our third year providing branded content for **Shell Rotella** as part of _**The Unsung Series**_. The series depicts everyday heroes doing what they love for a living. One of the three films premiering this week is **_The Last Mile_**, the story of a postal worker in Alaska whose community depends heavily on his services.

When our crew wasn’t busy shooting, they were having a blast. They rode dog sleds and snowmobiles on frozen lakes, and had to figure out how to jumpstart a van in the middle of a snowstorm.

Here’s a behind-the-scenes glimpse of what shooting _**The Last Mile**_ was like for crew member, **[Adam Uhl](http://www.adam-uhl.com/)**.
