We're so excited to share this new trailer for [LP](http://hoverpictures.com/projects/luis-pedro.html)! 

LP is a meditation of a brazilian manâ€™s reckoning of the space between life and death. The film is a hybrid approach to storytelling. It was originally shot as a documentary in 2012. 

In 2013 and 2014, director Ethan Goldwater decided to re-write the story as a narrative script, along with Danielle Lessovitz, in NYC. He finished shooting the piece in early 2014. LP is set to release at the film festivals in 2016.
