        <title>Hover Teams up With Found Sound Nation</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s amazing to see artists working in schools, especially public schools - in a flowing creative space. It takes hard work over time to build something like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://foundsoundnation.org/&quot;&gt;Found Sound Nation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a non-profit organization based in DUMBO, has been working at the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bcamhs.org/&quot;&gt;Brooklyn Community Arts and Media High School&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for years, partnering with BCAM’s music program and bringing artists to collaborate with students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/hover-fsn-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Found Sound Nation #1&quot; class=&quot;multi-post-single&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; This video documents one of the collaborations. The People’s Champs, a Brooklyn-based band,  teamed up for a two-week workshop with a select group of BCAM students with whom they wrote and produced original Hip-Hop songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our video begins by telling their story through glimpses in nascent songwriting stages at the workshop, in the basement studio of the school, interspersed with interviews from the students themselves relating their day-to-day lives and experiences. In these interviews we get a hint at their inner worlds and inspirations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/hover-fsn-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Found Sound Nation #2&quot; class=&quot;multi-post-single&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The students then get the opportunity to record their songs at a professional recording studio in the heart of Williamsburg: National Sawdust. After recording their songs, they perform them live during a concert with People’s Champs. Debuting their freshly recorded creations for a raucous crowd of family members and people in the music industry, we bear witness to a beautiful night of musical collaboration - a release of two weeks of intense creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hover Presents - Camila Falquez&#39;s Chinatown</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After a certain point, even living in a place like New York City can start to feel mundane. You fall into routines and as things become familiar, so too can they become a forgettable part of the daily grind. Which is why it’s so important that photographers like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.camilafalquez.com&quot;&gt;Camila Falquez&lt;/a&gt; are out there, reminding to look at the world around us with a little more consideration, with a little more love. Her compositions are powerful, thought provoking, and are as smart as they are immediately satisfying. She has a way of capturing the striking beauty in the every day. They feel classic, nostalgic for the present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were lucky enough to catch her in New York and get our &lt;a href=&quot;http://hoverpictures.com/about/&quot;&gt;portraits&lt;/a&gt; taken here at the Hover HQ. Ever at the helm of inspiration, Camila’s camera inevitably wandered out of our 2nd story studio and into the vibrant streets of Chinatown, reminding us of all the ways in which this neighborhood is really so, so special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/camila-chinatown-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Camila&#39;s Chinatown #1&quot; class=&quot;multi-post-two-up&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/camila-chinatown-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Camila&#39;s Chinatown #2&quot; class=&quot;multi-post-two-up&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hover Pictures:&lt;/em&gt; Tell us a bit about yourself - dreams, hopes, goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Camila Falquez:&lt;/em&gt; I was born in Mexico, raised in Spain and now I live in New York. My priority in life is traveling and understanding society, every day harder to define as I learn more about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hopes? Continuing to have the freedom I have to travel around with my camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/camila-chinatown-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Camila&#39;s Chinatown #3&quot; class=&quot;multi-post-two-up&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/camila-chinatown-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Camila&#39;s Chinatown #4&quot; class=&quot;multi-post-two-up&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;H:&lt;/em&gt; Were you thinking about anything in particular when you were taking these photographs? How do they resonate with you now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;C:&lt;/em&gt; When I shoot the streets, I try to leave my mind blank and let the visuals of what I’m exploring guide me. It’s almost like a meditation process, always very rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/camila-chinatown-5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Camila&#39;s Chinatown #5&quot; class=&quot;multi-post-single&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;H:&lt;/em&gt; When was the first time you visited Chinatown? Do you feel it’s changed much since, visually? If so, in what ways?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;C:&lt;/em&gt; Chinatown was one of the first areas I visited when I first moved to New York 4 years ago, and it blew me away. It still has the same effect on me; its energy and amazing contrasts captivate me enormously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/camila-chinatown-6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Camila&#39;s Chinatown #6&quot; class=&quot;multi-post-two-up&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/camila-chinatown-7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Camila&#39;s Chinatown #7&quot; class=&quot;multi-post-two-up&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;H:&lt;/em&gt; There’s a definite history of infatuation with the aesthetic and aura of Chinatown. What about it draws you in? What do you see in it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;C:&lt;/em&gt; The colors, the smells, people of all ages… all together produce a very vibrant melting pot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/camila-chinatown-8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Camila&#39;s Chinatown #8&quot; class=&quot;multi-post-two-up&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/camila-chinatown-9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Camila&#39;s Chinatown #9&quot; class=&quot;multi-post-two-up&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;H:&lt;/em&gt; I feel like there’s a real sense of the weather in these photographs that seems distinctly Chinatown. What was the weather actually like that day?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;C:&lt;/em&gt; It was a cloudy autumn day, which couln’t be any more perfect for the vibe of the pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/camila-chinatown-10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Camila&#39;s Chinatown #10&quot; class=&quot;multi-post-single&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;H:&lt;/em&gt; What are your favorite things to do in Chinatown?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;C:&lt;/em&gt; Firstly, just walking around rush hour and absorbing all of that energy; but also, at night, when all of those streets are asleep, it’s amazing to walk around in search of some good restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The More You Know - Hover Teams up with the Drug Policy Alliance</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last Sunday, Hover teamed up with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drugpolicy.org&quot;&gt;Drug Policy Alliance&lt;/a&gt; to create a film that combats the lingering effects of the war on drugs and zero tolerance, scared straight programs like D.A.R.E. These programs, while doing their part to prevent widespread drug abuse among young adults, have in the process ignored and prevented honest dialogue from happening on the subject. According to the DPA, this lack of transparency and conversation has led to an uncritical, self perpetuating culture of discrimination and marginalization based on a lack of real information. Today, the number of Americans incarcerated for drug offenses is larger than the entire prison and jail population was in 1980, and while African Americans only make up 14% of the drug using population, they make up 37% of drug offense arrests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Jerry Otero, DPA’s Youth Policy Director, “We vacillate between ‘just say no’ and ‘just say nothing’, or we embellish the facts with exaggerations and misinformation. Too often, the schism that exists between what we tell our children about drugs and their own lived experiences provokes cynicism, mistrust and even more curiosity. So much so, that once they are out on their own, many young folks seem primed for overindulgence. Sometimes with ill-effects.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Sunday, we got the conversation started. We conducted one-on-one conversations with young adults from all walks of life, asking them to share their experiences and opinions on drugs without judgement and wagging fingers. We asked them to fill in a blank, presented on a green chalkboard – “Drugs are …” The responses we got were articulate, challenging and powerful, planting seeds in the fault lines of our current drug policies. “Drugs are not the point” wrote Kristen, discussing the ways racial profiling interacts with drug policy, “There’s all this other shit going on. Lots about racism. Assumptions about people who use drugs”. “Drugs are control” wrote Chris, who reflected on his own experience with drug education. “Talking to my parents about drugs is funny for me.” said Sophie, “They are a little uncomfortable about it still.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the shoot, Jerry was kind enough to take some time and share his thoughts on the process and how it all went:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hover&lt;/strong&gt; – Hi Jerry, how’d the shoot go?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JO&lt;/strong&gt; – The shoot went very well! We had a great turn out, I think 18 out of the 20 kids we casted showed up which is fantastic. They were a little nervous in the beginning, but I think by the end of it they all left feeling very empowered and supported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hover&lt;/strong&gt; – Wow, that’s great to hear! How did you end up finding so many young people who were willing to talk so candidly about drugs in front of a camera?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JO&lt;/strong&gt; – We did a lot of our casting from the DPA network. I also have my own youth arts development program called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/cre8tiveYouth/&quot;&gt;Cre8tiveyouthink&lt;/a&gt;. We do a lot of murals around the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hover&lt;/strong&gt; – Nice. How was the whole proceess of collaboration with Hover?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jo&lt;/strong&gt; – You know, what really won me over was Hover’s level of detail and instrastructure. This all happened so quickly and smoothly and I felt like we ultimately got a lot more out of this than we envisioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hover&lt;/strong&gt; – About how long did the pre-production take?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JO&lt;/strong&gt; – Ethan and I met for the first time back in October during a Horizons conference and didn’t start discussing this project until a little bit after. We couldn’t have been in pre-production for this for more than 3 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hover&lt;/strong&gt; – Word. I’ve been checking out all the behind the scenes stills and in progress edits. It’s a really nice, focused feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JO&lt;/strong&gt; – Ethan came up with the idea for the chalkboard which was great. Can’t wait to see the first edits!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hover&lt;/strong&gt; – Same here Jerry!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Three Hover Films Premiere at SEMA Trade Event</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This week, three of our films will premiere at the The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.semashow.com&quot;&gt;SEMA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Show in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEMA&lt;/strong&gt; is the world’s leading automotive specialty products trade event. It draws the industry’s brightest minds and latest products. Attendees go to educational seminars, product demonstrations, and special events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is our third year providing branded content for &lt;strong&gt;Shell Rotella&lt;/strong&gt; as part of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Unsung Series&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The series depicts everyday heroes doing what they love for a living. One of the three films premiering this week is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Last Mile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, the story of a postal worker in Alaska whose community depends heavily on his services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When our crew wasn’t busy shooting, they were having a blast. They rode dog sleds and snowmobiles on frozen lakes, and had to figure out how to jumpstart a van in the middle of a snowstorm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a behind-the-scenes glimpse of what shooting &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Last Mile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; was like for crew member, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adam-uhl.com/&quot;&gt;Adam Uhl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lucas Films Moon Hooch Performance in Harlem</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Director &lt;a href=&quot;http://lucasmcgowen.com&quot;&gt;Lucas McGowen&lt;/a&gt; heads to Harlem tonight to participate in filming a live event put on by a trio of talented jazz artists known as &lt;strong&gt;Moon Hooch&lt;/strong&gt;. They’re known for their natural dance tunes, or “organic house music.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event will be held at the &lt;strong&gt;Cathedral of St. John the Divine&lt;/strong&gt;, the largest cathedral in the world and home to the month-long &lt;strong&gt;Value of Food – Sustaining a Green Planet Exhibit&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lucas’s cousin, &lt;strong&gt;Wenzl McGowen&lt;/strong&gt; plays saxophone for Moon Hooch. Last year, Lucas directed this energetic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUEapzqptIA&quot;&gt;music video&lt;/a&gt; that played at &lt;strong&gt;SXSW&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonight, Lucas collaborates with set-light artist &lt;strong&gt;John Zelenka&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;Manhattan Microwave Communications&lt;/strong&gt; – on laser light design, CO2, and smoke. The event will be captured on a C100 and two 5D cameras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sustainability is central to the rising band’s mission. Stay tuned for the footage of the night.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New Trailer for LP</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We’re so excited to share this new trailer for &lt;a href=&quot;http://hoverpictures.com/projects/luis-pedro.html&quot;&gt;LP&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LP is a meditation of a brazilian man’s reckoning of the space between life and death. The film is a hybrid approach to storytelling. It was originally shot as a documentary in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2013 and 2014, director Ethan Goldwater decided to re-write the story as a narrative script, along with Danielle Lessovitz, in NYC. He finished shooting the piece in early 2014. LP is set to release at the film festivals in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
