  p1: "Ethan is a director and the founder of Hover. He was raised in a big family by social workers who taught him about what it means to get involved in the lives of others. Inspired by the complexity of inner work and sensory rich experiences that get at the edges, he has led creative projects that matter to him and his community since 2003. With an interdisciplinary background in music, journalism and education, he fell into the filmmaking process in 2008, and hasn’t been able to stop since."

  q1: "Do remember seeing anything in particular as a child that initiated a desire to make films?"
  a1: "Pigeons, cats, art on my great-grandmother’s wall and rock sculpture in her garden, grandfather’s boats, Dad making a hoop with his arms for me to shoot a little basketball through. 'The eyes are the window into the soul' is a matter of fact."
  q2: "How would you define “wonder,” and when do you find it finds you?"
  a2: "Wonder is the confluence of natural element and craft. I find it through focus, on anything really. Yoga, cycling, walking in the woods."
  q3: "What is the everyday importance of making movies for our society? What does it mean to you to have these tools available?"
  a3: "Ritual and sacrifice are necessary to mark these moments where we accept the traumas of our everyday life, and purge. Rather than say slaughtering a goat, now we can just go to the movies. For me, making films is about celebrating the work each one of us does to survive and build, experiencing the extremes of the human condition, pain, recovery, rebirth… the joys and the pains of life. This is what I love."
  q4: "When did you decide that you wanted to pursue a job in the film industry?"
  a4: "It wasn’t so much of a choice as a matter of compulsion to make work. And when I had some issues getting into the teacher’s union, I decided to pursue the work full time. Am grateful to be a part of this evolving work."

  p1: "Raised by his single mother, a painter, Lucas grew up between the beaches of California and Mexico and the rich forests of Monteverde, Costa Rica and Woodstock, New York. He spent much of his time in the forest camping and biking. In his films Lucas continues to explore his love of nature, at once the discoverer and the creator of the world depicted on screen. Lucas has become a favorite of musicians Lionbabe, Moonhooch, Yesway and Andrea Diaz, for his mystifying music videos."
  p2: "His short films have been featured at Sundance, the Brooklyn Film Festival, SXSW, and Art Basel. His first short film 'Three Brothers' premiered at the Brooklyn Film Festival in 2012 and was acquired by indieflix.com for online distribution. Two of his short films will be shown in the 2015 Italian film festival Premio Cinematografico Palena. He is currently in pre-production for his next film titled “Rosendale” based on the New Yorker short story by Paul Lafarge. Lucas lives in Brooklyn NY."
  q1: "In three words, what do you strive to have your work encompass?"
  a1: "Truth. Beauty. Mystery."
  q2: "Were you artistic as a child?"
  a2: "As a child I was obsessed with flight. I built hundreds of balsa wood airplanes. I would go around telling anyone who would listen that I was going to be an aeronautical engineer."
  q3: "Describe your personal creative process of harnessing inspiration. Do you have a set routine, or does it vary?"
  a3: "I try not to harness inspiration so much as let it flow through me. When you try to harness something the energy becomes stale, it dies. I believe any artist in any medium is nothing more than an antenna."
  q4: "3D is coming, fast. Does this excite you?"
  a4: "The last film I directed was a short horror piece, shot in 3D. The learning curve is very steep. It is both exciting and intimidating. While it is certainly the way of the future, I think relatively few people are fully utilizing the third dimension's potential. Right now many 3D films are simply 2D films shot in 3D so I'm looking forward to watching the evolution of 3D filmmaking."

He is a musician and an avid basketball enthusiast. He studied philosophy and photography at Bard college and has since focused his talent for storytelling through the medium of film. He has had the honor of working with artists such as Prince and Beyonce, and is currently working on a feature length documentary on the life of artist, Kenny Scharf."
  q1: "What makes a good story?"
  a1: "In my mind a good story maintains all the essential elements of surprise while revealing hidden truths about the human condition. A good story inspires change. A good story is timeless."
  q2: "Were you artistic as a child?"
  a2: "As a child I was more prone to the thrill of live action sports ;) I did play music from a very early age though."
  q3: "Does your upbringing influence your work today?"
  a3: "My mother ran a dried flower company up until I was 16. I think that being surrounded by flowers on a day to day basis had a strong effect on my imagination."
  q4: "What current projects are you excited about right now?"
  a4: "I am currently Directing/Editing a feature doc about Kenny Scharf and the downtown art scene of the early 80's in NY which I am very excited about."

  p1: "Zach began his career in documentary films, shooting for multiple award-winning docs including the latest Netflix original, Mission Blue. With this strong foundation in verite style, his narrative and commercial work carry with them all the life and truth we love about documentary films. By blending this visual style with unique and often quirky stories, he blurs the lines of reality in order to explore who we are and what we are doing here."
  q1: "The eyes, as many have noted, are our first “lens.” Do you remember seeing anything in particular as a child that initiated a desire to make films?"
  a1: "Beyond my early fascination with nature and my love of animals-- which has taught me a lot about looking for the unseen-- I think that skateboarding and BMX videos were really my earliest inspirations for making films. The first movies I made as a kid, when I was around 13, were all BMX videos. I got my hands on a HI8 DV cam and taught myself about angles and exposure, mostly by copying videos I watched daily."
  q2: "When did you decide that you wanted to pursue a job in the film industry?"
  a2: "I was all set to begin applying to doctorate programs in experimental psychology my last year of college. Suddenly my advisor said, 'I noticed you love films. Have you ever thought about pursuing that?' I said yes-- but wasn't sure how. He said he wouldn't write me any recommendations until I tried to do that for a year. Doctorate programs are grueling, and he wanted me to make absolutely sure I had my heart in it. Turns out it was in filmmaking."
  q3: "Which narratives, in whatever medium, have inspired your sense of storytelling?"
  a3: "Children's books to this day inspire me a great deal. I think my first love of storytelling was Shel Silverstein, his anthology of poems 'Where the Sidewalk Ends' and 'The Giving Tree.' Most recently, I have fallen in love with writers who emphasize the magic of coincidence, like Tom Robbins, Kurt Vonnegut, Kobe Abe, and Murakami. "
  q4: "Describe your personal creative process of harnessing inspiration. Do you have a set routine, or does it vary?"
  a4: "It totally varies, but it usually involves music. I feel like music can send me messages about visuals, often times completely random and unrelated to wherever I am or what the song is about."
