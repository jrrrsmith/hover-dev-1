This video documents one of the collaborations. The People’s Champs, a Brooklyn-based band,  teamed up for a two-week workshop with a select group of BCAM students with whom they wrote and produced original Hip-Hop songs."
  description_1: "Found Sound Nation is a collective of musicians and artists who leverage the unique power of creative sound-making to help build strong, just, healthy communities. They facilitate collaborations between professional musicians and the community to promote their mission and encourage others to pursue their inner music-making genius. FSN partnered with Brooklyn Community Arts and Media High School (BCAM) for a two week hip-hop production workshop. This hands-on workshop was led by the bandmembers of People’s Champs, a Brooklyn-based funk band. People’s Champs taught a select group of BCAM students how to bring their hip-hop songs to fruition during a two week in-school workshop."
  description_2: "Our video begins by telling their story through glimpses of the nascent songwriting stages at the workshop located at BCAM and also film  in-depth interviews with the students themselves. In these interviews get a hint at their inner thoughts and what shapes their own musical practice. We also dive into the nitty-gritty of the musical process, showing the drudgery and confusion of the beginning stages and the relentless drive and perfectionism needed to propel the songs from paper to the recording booth. We then go to National Sawdust, a recording studio and performance hall where the students will finish their songs and then perform them for an audience filled with their families and people from the music industry."

- title: "REDD"
  date: "2015"
  medium: "short fiction film"
  logline: "When a little boy named Redd loses his ball to the woods, he encounters a monster."
  synopsis: "Redd, a four year old boy, loses his favorite ball. Despite his mother’s disapproval, he ventures into the woods to look for it. He meets Wembley, a good monster who assures him that he will reunite Redd with his beloved toy."
  description_1: "Director's Statement: “The original concept for Redd came out of my time spent with the real four year old boy named Redd. Before him, I had worked with children and certainly had met a few that inspired me and brought a positive light into my life, but I had never been so moved by a child’s imagination before him. At the time when I wrote the script I was going through a very rough breakup with my girlfriend and was moving to a new studio and was feeling very depressed in general. By chance, I ran into Redd on the street one day with his father, who is a friend of mine, and without missing a beat Redd said, 'Zach Sky! We are gonna be pirates and we gotta go find the treasure!' He handed me one of the two toy swords that he had brought with him to the park that day and off we went. Completely without fear, he engaged with strangers on the sidewalk by yelling 'Rrrrrrr' and warning them of bad guys that we had passed two blocks earlier. He picked up discarded soda cans and called them canon balls, spotted huge green NYC tour buses and dubbed them sea monsters, and never missed a chance to swashbuckle with a 'NO PARKING' sign. I found myself so immersed in his game that I walked him all the way home as his first mate and had forgotten all about my adult woes in the city."
  description_2: "This story came from wanting to show the importance of a strong imagination and how it can transcend even the strongest negative feelings and bring happiness and light into dark places. For the past four years I have been working on documentary films, and because of this I had the urge to make something that had that feeling of truth, or a sort of verité style. I mentioned this to my close friend Max Basch who is a cinematographer and he was immediately inspired by the idea of a fantasy verité project and jumped on board. He has an amazing presence with the camera, and his voyeuristic style felt perfect for the spirit camera that I was looking to create for this story."
  description_3: "Through his imagination, Redd created this moment of awareness and presence that I wanted to capture, and I think that it's something everyone can relate to and gain from, not just children.”"
